User Story / Gameplay
    Describe the gameplay
        Upon start, a ball will be placed in the middle of the screen, along with two bars. Once the ball
        begins to move, players will move their bar to prevent it from moving past it. The ball will bounce
        between the moving bars and a player gains a point when the ball moves past their opponent's bar. The
        game ends when a player reaches 11 points.
    What are the conditions when the game begins?
        When the game begins, a ball is at the middle of the screen with two bars on either side of it.
    Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
        The game does have an end, and a restart. When the ball moves past a paddle, it is recentered and a 
        new round begins. The game ends when a player has 11 points.
    What ifs will there be?
        - If the ball hits the bar, it will bounce back in the opposite direction.
        - If the ball hits a wall, it will also bounce back in the opposite direction.
        - If the ball moves past the bar, it will recenter and a player will gain a point.
        - If a player reaches 11 points, then the game ends.

Events / Logic
    What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
        - Mouse events
    How do those events affect the data of the program?
        - When the mouse moves, so will the bar's position.
    For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
        - When the ball hits the walls/bars:
            The speed is multiplied by -1, moving it in the opposite direction
        - When the mouse moves:
            The bars will move
        - When the ball moves past the bar:
            The ball's position is reset
            One player's point total increased by 1

For example: in bouncing box, when the box is clicked:

The speed is increased
The point total goes up by 1 and is displayed on the box
The position of the box is reset to 0
